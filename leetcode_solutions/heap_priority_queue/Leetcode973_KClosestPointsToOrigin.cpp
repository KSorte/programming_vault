    Leetcode 973 K Closest Points to Origin
    Given an array of points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer k,
    return the k closest points to the origin (0, 0).

    The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., âˆš(x1 - x2)2 + (y1 - y2)2).

    You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

    Algorithm:
    Use min heap priority queue. Optimize well.
