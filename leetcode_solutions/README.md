Note:
Problem 22 Generate Parentheses needs be revisited during Backtracking, Decision Trees, Recursion and Tree Search.
This problem even though using a stack is more significantly belonging to one of the above groups.

Leetcode 128 - Longest Consecutive Sequence : Was a hard crack, the trick is very nuanced and may not strike immediately.

Leetcode 853 : Did not need the usage of stacks. The trick did not strike organically.

Leetcode 84 - Did not need stacks.

Leetcode 543 Diameter of Binary Tree and Leetcode 110 Balanced Binary Tree used DFS with recursion. Very peculiar technique.

Leetcode 424 Longest Repeating Character Replacement: Most important from the sliding window section;
Count of the most occuring letter after moving the left pointer need not be recalculated.
It is recalculated currently by iterating over the map.
