## Notes

**Investible Periods**: Hard problem. Could only crack the brute force solution. Revise it before a major coding round.
All test cases do not pass yet.

**Intersections**: This is a good problem to understand how to create custom operators in C++. Custom operator < is needed to process a struct in a priority queue in this problem. A must read to understand operators and a neat usage of priority queues.
